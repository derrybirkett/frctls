			<h1>🔄 Fractals of Change</h1>
			<p>
				<strong>Small changes work.</strong> Welcome to a new approach to organizational transformation 
				designed specifically for enterprise directors who need to drive cultural change without disruption.
			</p>
			<p>
				Traditional change management fails because it tries to transform everything at once. 
				Fractals of Change applies mathematical principles to organizational behavior, creating 
				sustainable transformation through strategic, small-scale interventions that naturally scale.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Why Fractals Work in Organizations</h2>
			<p>
				Just as fractals in nature create complex patterns from simple rules, organizational 
				change can propagate throughout your enterprise when you identify and modify the right 
				cultural tokens—those small behaviors and processes that influence everything else.
			</p>

			<h2>For Enterprise Directors</h2>
			<p>
				You're responsible for productivity across large teams, but traditional change initiatives 
				are expensive, disruptive, and often fail. Our approach gives you:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Measurable impact</strong> from day one</li>
				<li><strong>Low-risk implementation</strong> that doesn't disrupt operations</li>
				<li><strong>Scalable strategies</strong> that work across departments</li>
				<li><strong>Cultural transformation</strong> that sticks</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Latest Insights</h2>
			<p>
				Explore our latest thinking on organizational transformation, cultural tokens, 
				and practical strategies for enterprise-scale change management.
