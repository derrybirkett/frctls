# Drafts Directory

This directory contains blog posts that are scheduled for future publication.

## Usage

1. Create new blog posts in this directory with future `pubDate` values
2. The content automation workflow will automatically move posts to the `blog/` directory when their publish date arrives
3. Use the same frontmatter format as published posts

## Scheduling

Posts are checked for publication every Tuesday and Friday at 9 AM UTC.
You can also manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab.
