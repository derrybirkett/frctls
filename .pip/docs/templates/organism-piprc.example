# .piprc — organism configuration for the .pip kernel

# Format: KEY=VALUE (one per line)
# - Lines starting with '#' are comments
# - Avoid secrets here; use .envrc for tokens and credentials
#
# Resolution order:
# 1) environment variables (e.g., PIP_MODE=execute)
# 2) this file (.piprc)
# 3) defaults baked into the kernel

PIPRC_VERSION=1

# Execution mode (agent guardrails)
# observe | propose | execute
# Recommended default for most projects is 'propose'.
PIP_MODE=propose

# Action mode (execution strategy)
# live: run commands normally
# confirm: prompt before side-effecting commands
# dry-run: avoid side effects (currently only `pip wrap` is supported)
PIP_ACTION_MODE=live
