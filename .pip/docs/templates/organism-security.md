# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, contact the maintainers privately with:

- a description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- impact assessment (what could an attacker do?)
- any suggested fixes or mitigations

We will acknowledge receipt and work on a fix.
