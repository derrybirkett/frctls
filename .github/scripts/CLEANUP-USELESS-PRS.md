# Cleanup Useless Pull Requests

## Problem

The repository had 29 open automated pull requests (PRs #97-124) that were created by the `autonomous-roadmap-agent` workflow. These PRs were generated by a scheduled trigger that has since been removed in PR #125.

## Solution

We've created a GitHub Actions workflow to close these useless PRs.

## How to Use

### Option 1: GitHub Actions Workflow (Recommended)

1. Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the "Close Useless PRs" workflow from the left sidebar
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. **First run with dry_run=true** to see which PRs will be closed (default)
5. Review the output to confirm the correct PRs are targeted
6. **Run again with dry_run=false** to actually close the PRs

### Option 2: Manual Script (If you have gh CLI authenticated)

If you have the GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated, you can run:

```bash
.github/scripts/close-useless-prs.sh
```

## PRs Targeted for Closure

All PRs with the following criteria:
- PR numbers: 97-124
- Title: "🤖 [Auto] Implement roadmap task"
- Created by: github-actions[bot]
- State: Open

## Why These PRs Are Useless

1. They were created automatically by a scheduled workflow
2. The scheduled trigger was removed in PR #125
3. These PRs were not properly reviewed or completed
4. They clutter the repository's PR list

## Prevention

The scheduled trigger has been removed from the `autonomous-roadmap-agent.yml` workflow, so no new automated PRs will be created unless manually triggered via `workflow_dispatch`.
